# What is Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED and How to Use It?
 
Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED is a powerful software that allows forensic experts and law enforcement agencies to perform full file system and logical acquisition of iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices. The software can image device file system, extract device secrets (passwords, encryption keys and protected data) and decrypt the file system image. It can also extract and decrypt protected keychain items, disable screen lock for smooth acquisition, and support all generations of iOS devices from iOS 4 to iOS 16.

In this article, we will explain what are the main features and benefits of Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED, how to use it for different types of extraction, and what are the system requirements and limitations of the software.
 
## Main Features and Benefits of Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED
 
Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED offers several advantages over other forensic tools for iOS devices. Some of the main features and benefits are:
 
- Full file system extraction and keychain decryption without a jailbreak: The software can access the entire file system of iOS devices without requiring a jailbreak. This means that it can preserve the original state of the device and avoid potential evidence tampering. It can also decrypt the keychain items that store passwords, encryption keys and other sensitive data.
- Logical acquisition extracts backups, crash logs, media and shared files: The software can perform logical acquisition of iOS devices by extracting iTunes backups, crash logs, media files and shared files. This can provide additional information that may not be available in the file system image.
- Passcode unlock and physical acquisition for legacy devices: The software can unlock devices with an unknown screen lock passcode using a brute-force attack. This works for legacy devices based on 32-bit processors such as iPhone 4S/5/5C. It can also perform physical acquisition of these devices by dumping the raw data from the device memory.
- Repeatable, forensically sound extraction for select iPhone and iPad models through modified bootloader: The software can use a modified bootloader exploit called checkm8 to perform forensically sound extraction of select iPhone and iPad models based on 64-bit processors such as iPhone 8/X/SE 2020. This method works entirely in the RAM and does not modify the file system or leave any traces on the device. It supports devices running iOS 7 through iOS 16.
- Partial file system extraction up to iOS 16.1.2: The software can extract parts of the file system from devices running up to iOS 16.1.2 using a low-level extraction method. This method can access sandboxes and working data sets of third-party apps along with some system databases. It supports devices based on A11 through A16 Bionic chips as well as Apple M1/M2 chips.

## How to Use Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED for Different Types of Extraction
 
Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED can perform different types of extraction depending on the device model, OS version, security settings and user preferences. Here are some general steps for using the software for different types of extraction:

1. Connect the device to a macOS computer via USB cable.
2. Launch Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED on the computer.
3. Select the type of extraction you want to perform: full file system extraction (F), logical acquisition (L), passcode unlock (U) or checkm8 extraction (C).
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the extraction process.
5. Analyze the extracted data using Elcomsoft Phone Viewer or other forensic tools.

## System Requirements and Limitations of Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED
 
Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit ED has some system requirements and limitations that users should be aware of before using it. Some of them are:

- The software is currently available only for macOS computers. Linux and Windows editions are in development.
- The software requires an Internet connection to download matching firmware files from Apple servers during checkm8 extraction.
- The software supports 76 Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Apple Watch and 0f148eb4a0
